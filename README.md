This is code for producing charts (shown below) of the attitudes towards immigration of Sinn Féin voters. I write about these charts in this [blog post](https://pollingstation.substack.com/p/how-sinn-fein-blew-it).

Unfortunately, I cannot share the data since it is not in the public domain. If you would like to replicate these charts, you can request access to the data from the [Electoral Commission](https://www.neds.ie/index.php?page=data).
